# Features
As the name suggests, it is a submission app website where user select answers of the question and it will store them to the database. <br/>
The question cards are responsive, flexible and draggable. This is done using react-beautiful-dnd. <br/>
You can see your responses by clicking to the Analysis section. <br/>
For future scaling of the project, contextAPI is used to collect the fetched data for the frontend. <br/>
Difficulties faced: The main problem was to implement react-beautiful-dnd as I have tried all possible ways but it was not going to work. All my codes are working properly but this create some problem for me initially but now all is working fine.
<br/>
I could not add the authentication and autherization due to time contrains. Already it has been 3 days on working this. But I am aware about how to achieve authentication and authorization by protected routes and JWT token. Will try it for sure!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
